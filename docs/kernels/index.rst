This is our first actively mantained kernel, built with a R&D fashion from a fork of Stack Over Flow Python questions dataset.
The idea is to follow the same data-processing workflow of (this kernel)[https://www.kaggle.com/alessandrosolbiati/identifying-clusters-of-related-questions-088d3f] and apply it to our dataset.
